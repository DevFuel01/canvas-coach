# 🎨 Canvas Coach  
### AI Visual Art Coach for Beginners

Canvas Coach is an AI-assisted creativity web application that helps **absolute beginners learn visual art through step-by-step coaching**.  
Instead of creating artwork for users, the AI acts as a **mentor and guide**, explaining artistic principles, giving constructive feedback, and suggesting clear next steps while the user creates their own original art.

This project was built for the **InnovArt International Hackathon**, focusing on ethical, human-centered AI in creative education.

## 🚀 Elevator Pitch
**An AI creative coach that helps beginners learn visual art step-by-step — without creating the art for them.**

---

## 🎯 Problem
Many beginners want to learn visual art but struggle with:
- Not knowing where to start
- Lack of real-time feedback
- Overwhelming professional tools
- AI tools that replace creativity instead of teaching it

As a result, beginners lose confidence and quit early.

---

## 💡 Solution
Canvas Coach uses AI as a **creative mentor**, not a creator.

The system:
- Guides beginners through the art process
- Explains visual art principles in simple language
- Gives focused, actionable feedback
- Encourages learning, confidence, and originality

The human always creates the art.  
The AI only **guides, explains, and supports**.
